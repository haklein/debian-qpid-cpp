Linear Store issues:

Current/pending:
================
 Q-JIRA RHBZ     Description / Comments
 ------ -------  ----------------------
   5359 -        Linearstore: Implement new management schema and wire into store
   5360 -        Linearstore: Evaluate and rework logging to produce a consistent log output
   5361 -        Linearstore: No tests for linearstore functionality currently exist
                   svn r.1564893 2014-02-05: Added tx-test-soak.sh
                   svn r.1564935 2014-02-05: Added license text to tx-test-soak.sh
                   * No existing tests for linearstore:
                   ** Basic broker-level tests for txn and non-txn recovery
                   ** Store-level tests which check write boundary conditions
                   ** EFP tests, including file recovery, error management
                   ** Unit tests
                   ** Basic performance tests
   5362 -        Linearstore: No store tools exist for examining the journals
                   svn r.1556888 2014-01-09: WIP checkin for linearstore version of qpid_qls_analyze. Needs testing and tidy-up.
                   svn r.1560530 2014-01-22: Bugfixes for qpid_qls_analyze
                   svn r.1561848 2014-01-27: Bugfixes and enhancements for qpid_qls_analyze
                   svn r.1564808 2014-02-05: Bugfixes and enhancements for qpid_qls_analyze
                   * Store analysis and status
                   * Recovery/reading of message content
                   * Empty file pool status and management
   5464 -        [linearstore] Incompletely created journal files accumulate in EFP
   5484 1035843  Slow performance for producers
                   svn r.1558592 2014-01-15 fixes an issue with using /dev/random as a source of random numbers for Journal serial numbers.
                   svn r.1558913 2014-01-16 replaces use of /dev/urandom with several calls to rand() to construct a 64-bit random number.
                   * Recommend rebuilding and testing for performance again with these two fixes. Marked POST.
   -    1039522  Qpid crashes while recovering from linear store around apid::linearstore::journal::JournalFile::getFqFileName() including enq_rec::decode() threw JERR_JREC_BAD_RECTAIL
                   * Possible dup of 1039525
                   * May be fixed by QPID-5483 - waiting for needinfo, recommend rebuilding with QPID-5483 fix and re-testing. Marked POST.
   -    1039525  Qpid crashes while recovering from linear store around apid::linearstore::journal::jexception::format including enq_rec::decode() threw JERR_JREC_BAD_REC_TAIL
                   * Possible dup of 1039522
                   * May be fixed by QPID-5483 - waiting for needinfo, recommend rebuilding with QPID-5483 fix and re-testing. Marked POST.
#  -    1049870  [LinearStore] auto-delete property does not survive restart

See above sections for details on these checkins.

Future work:
============
* One journal file lost when queue deleted. All files except for one are recycled back to the EFP.
* Complete exceptions - several exceptions thrown using jexception have no exception numbers
* Investigate ability of store to detect missing journal files, especially from logical end of a journal
* Investigate ability of store to handle file muddle-ups (ie journal files from EFP which are not zeroed or other journals)
* Look at improving the efficiency of recovery - right now the entire store is read once, and then each recovered record xid and data is read again

Code tidy-up
------------
* Remove old comments
* Use c++ cast templates instead of (xxx)y
* Member names: xxx_
* Rename classes, functions and variables to camel-case
* Add Doxygen docs to classes
* Make fid's consistent in name (fid, file_id, pfid) and format (hex vs decimal)
